# Cortex-A9

The ARM® Cortex®-A9 processor is a popular general purpose choice for low-power 
or thermally constrained, cost-sensitive 32-bit devices.

The Cortex-A9 processor is proven in a wide range of devices and is one of ARM's 
most widely deployed and mature applications processors. Cortex-A9 processor 
offers an overall performance enhancement over 25% higher than Cortex-A8 per core, 
plus the ability to implement multi-core designs that further scale the performance increase.

The Cortex-A9 implements the widely supported ARMv7-A architecture with an efficient microarchitecture:

* High-efficiency, dual-issue superscalar, out-of-order, dynamic length pipeline (8 – 11 stages)
* Highly configurable L1 caches, and optional NEON and Floating-point extensions
* Available as a Single processor configuration, or a scalable multi-core configuration with up to 4 coherent cores

For the most high-end 32-bit devices, Cortex-A17 delivers more performance and 
efficiency in a similar footprint than it’s predecessor, the Cortex-A9. 
They are based of a similar pipeline, with Cortex-A17 extending the capabilities 
in single thread performance and adding big.LITTLE support and virtualization 
that were not in the original Cortex-A9 offering.

## Key Benefits

Scalable performance and power efficiency for a broad range of 32-bit consumer, networking, enterprise and mobile applications
Support the wide ARMv7-A 32-bit software eco-system
Mature and silicon proven in multiple process technologies

## Applications

The Cortex-A9 processor is suitable for low-power, cost-sensitive 32-bit devices which require competitive power efficiency. Beyond being one of ARM’s most successful mobile phone processors, it is now successfully implemented for a range of other products.
